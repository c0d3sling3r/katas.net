Stack



Implement your own stack (existing .NET implementations are not allowed (list, array, â€¦)



The stack should have the following methods:



Push(object): Adds an element to the stack.
Pop(): Returns the last element and removes it from the stack.
Peek(): Returns the last element without removing it.
